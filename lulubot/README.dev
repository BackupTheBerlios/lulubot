Note about contributing to LuluBot Project :
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


* LuluBot core contributions
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
It concerns all what is not in skills/ directory nor SmartIrc/. Once
again there is a choice :

- the change is minor, or you prefer not to bother, then you can give 
  the copyright to the declared copyright holders by including the 
  Licence header provided in INCLUDE_HEADER file (or INCLUDE_SHELL
  for inclusion in a shell-type file).

- contribution is significant, then you may join the group of 
  copyright holders upon their agreement. Agreement acquisition is 
  a request sent to each existing copyright holders and no negative
  answer in two weeks and at least one positive answer.


* Skills contributions
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
They are quite easy to add and remove, as modules, and are considered 
as independant. For contributing skills authors have 2 choices :

- either consider the skill contribution is similar to a core
  contribution, in which case apply conditions explained above.

- either use a LGPL or BSD, in which case the skill will be bundled
  in the main LGPL LuluBot package. 

- either use your own choice of OSI-compliant free software licence
  then it will be available but packaged in an extra multi-licenced
  package.


* SmartIrc 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
The content of SmartIrc and SmartIrc.php are an independant
third-party source code. Do not change anything there, prefer to 
contribute to SmartIrc project directly : 

  http://sf.net/projects/phpsmartirc


* Current copyright holders
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
* Lulu Enterprises, Inc., patron,
  represented by Christian Fowler <cfowler@lulu.com>
* mose <mose@mose.fr>, main coder and maintainer
